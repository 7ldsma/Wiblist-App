# Wiblist App

This application is under development. 

The objective of this app is to ease the process of a collaborative gif purchase by visually organizing the gift information (Gift option pictures, Budget, Date, participants).

In this app, users may have one of the following 3 roles, based on the involvement they want to have in the purchase organization.

| User         | Description                                                                                                               | Permissions                                            |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Organizer    | Sets up the dashboard, where all the gift information will be displayed. Sends participation invitations through WhatsApp | Invite participants Delete participants Edit Dashboard |
| Collaborator | Users who are willing to actively participate in the organization of the gift purchasing process                          | Edit Dashboard                                         |
| Participant  | Users who will only have economic participation in the purchase of the gift.                                              | View Dashboard                                         |

The idea with this is to avoid creating WhatsApp groups with very extensive conversations in which it is difficult to find important information; and ensure an easier and more enjoyable experience for all users according to their level of participation.
